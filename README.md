Flashcards App Project for Thinkful Bootcamp

Create a web app with the ability to create decks of cards. 

A user should have the ability to create new decks or edit existing ones via a form.
Each deck should contain cards.

Each card should have a front and back side
that can be edited via a form to either add new cards or edit an existing one.
Each card should have a flip button to display the text on the front/back of the card.
If on the back of the card, a next button should be displayed to cycle to the next card in the deck.
If a user clicks "Next" on the last card to be deleted, a prompt should show up asking whether the user wants to
restart studying the deck, or to return to the homepage to pick a new deck to study.

Decks and cards should be able to be deleted.
